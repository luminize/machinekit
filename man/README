Install doclifter

build the repo for RIP as normal

cd /man

`make-txt`  will generate a list file for each of the man dirs - man1.txt, man3.txt and man9.txt

`lift-manpages` will pass each item in the list to doclifter, create the .xml file and then
move the .xml files to xml-docs/man?

The output will highlight the existing problems with the groff / troff formatting that it cannot 
resolve.

Since these are mostly with generated comp / icomps, that needs resolving within the sources
before we go anywhere.
