# HAL Ringbuffer demo

# this creates the named ringsdelays ring_0 ... ring_1
loadrt ringdelay num_delay=2 num_channel=3 single_ring_size=3000

# make 2 threads, slow fast and slow 1ms/1s
loadrt threads name1=fast period1=1000000 name2=slow period2=1000000000

# add the following functions to the thread
addf ringdelay.0.read-input fast
